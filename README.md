Student Grievance Redressal  

 Introduction  
 
1. The Student Grievance Redressal System is designed to create a transparent, structured, and reliable way for students to raise concerns.  
2. Traditional methods like paper forms or informal complaints often get delayed or ignored; this system ensures grievances are properly **documented and tracked**.  
3. The platform provides fairness and accountability by involving students, faculty, and administrators in a role-based workflow.  
4. It encourages timely resolution of academic, administrative, or personal issues that impact student life.  
5. By digitizing the process, institutions can improve efficiency, reduce delays, and strengthen student trust.  
6. The system is not only about complaint managementâ€”it is about building a student-friendly and responsive academic environment**.
